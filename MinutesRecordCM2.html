<h2><p>Client MEETING 2</p>  
<p>Date of Meeting: 2014-01-27</p>
<p>Duration Time: 12:00 – 1:30 PM</p>
<p>List of Attendees: Andy, David, Phattrick, Kenneth, Matthew, Jon</p> 
<p>Meeting Location/Communication Medium Used: ICCS Room X237</p></h2> 
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Detail Response from Client regarding Email Questions:

-	Interface design can be based of Kin HR as an ideal
-	Start fresh and don’t worry about integration with PHP and the existing
system. However Sean does suggest that we use PHP.  
-	BSD is what we are going to go with the licensing. 
-	If we decide to use any messaging services or databases? They are currently
using AWS. Think of the project as a stand-alone service so create your own
testing database and don’t worry about the integration. 
-	We are set on using email as volunteer identification 
</code></pre>
<pre><code>System Features 

-	Fields for the organizers in their sign up input are available on the Pitch’n
cite (title, phone number, social media fields, roles, etc). The registration is
going to be handled by the Pitch’n so we don’t have to worry too much about registration.
After they have finished the registration, they’ll then access our designed system.
In summary, the registration does not need to be handled by our team but we need to
setup a login with email and password (Ex. Test@Test.com with a password).
-	 You’ll need 3 different logins, for volunteer, organizer users, Pitch’n admin.
Thus for the dashboard after login, there needs to be 3 different views. The layout
of the login will be the same. The layout for the dashboard could be similar with
restriction of functionalities. A possible solution in managing the system for multiple
user views could have multiple tabs for each user type view for the same Email account. 
-	Password forgotten, standard solution, set email notification for password reset. 
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Database Management 

-	When you go to the team view page, you can browse by skill, by location, by project
(chose filters by choosing a drop down).  
-	There should also be a general search field (for example, you can search by name)
-	Filter search can be performed by a list of drop downs. 
-	Start simple for now 
-	The search result should be a list of volunteer users with a checkbox for each user
that once selected, you can chose a specific action to the selected portion of the list
-	You can also SAVE PRE-LOADED Filter list for the user so that it can be quickly
selected and action performed. 
-	There should be options to save frequently searched items, to save long time users
with excessive amounts of “clicks”
-	The system should be centred around the volunteers 
-	Projects are treated as folder – (volunteers can be view based on project and can
access or receive different information) 
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Landing Page for the Organization Coordinators: 

-	They should be able to see the “Status” of all their projects 
(percent completion for the project.  Number of volunteers, project on
schedule (is there on time, things that need to be reviewed). These status
updates will be updated by the volunteers that are part of the associating
projects. This will reflect on the completion of tasks by the volunteers 
-	They can see new notifications
-	Any actions that needs to be completed for the project
-	List of coming milestones or dates
-	List of tasks to complete  
-	Messages waiting approval 
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Features for the System

-	Uploading CSV for bulk data. There could be volunteers in the list that are no
longer active, so that each volunteers should be sent with the email notification
for their confirmation on agreeing to be active in the system that their organizers
have added them to. Once they confirmed, send them an associating generated password
for their email for login. They can then go into their account later and change their
passwords. If they don’t reply for 2 weeks, they will be remove from the system and
would have to re-apply.  
-	Upload manually individually option available. You should be able to assign the
volunteers as you add them into the system. 
-	 Assign “ALL” volunteers to a certain project (should be multiple select) 
-	Remove volunteer - can be done both by the volunteer and the organizations.
Removal organizations should be notified by email.  Associating note can be added
in the email on confirmation of volunteer removal. 
-	Remove organization.  
-	Admin should also be able to do this and notification should be the same by
email with note attached. 
-	Minimal deliverable with CSV template 
</code></pre>  
<pre><code>Volunteer Landing Page

-	Leaving a project or organization

default to the project 

</code></pre>
<pre><code>Filtering and finding volunteers  

-	Search by tags, volunteer organization can set up by tags 
(tags for now are optional, we can have set fields for now) 

</code></pre>
<pre><code>What is a project?

-	It’s a folder
-	Organization 
-	Project name
-	List of Projects Role
-	Multiple Volunteers per Role 
-	Each Role can have multiple tasks
-	Role assignment is done mostly but coordinators based on
skills available  in each volunteer 
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Data Structure: 

-	Org -> Proj -> Role -> Task, number, of volunteers
-	Under each Role – role number, title, description, amount of
volunteers, timeline, deliverables, task list

On-Boarding 

-	On boarding page for every project
