<pre><code>System Requirements 

-	Client needs a login for volunteer and import volunteer information and
MANAGE the information (top importance) 
-	CRM, 2 categories, import CSV file with list of volunteer, after you
import, you should be able to filter volunteer information.  Tailor a database
with all the associating columns that Pitch’n has. A) We need to be able to
import B) we need to be able to filter search. 
-	Send default documents to volunteers that signed up. 
-	Scheduling – jest is like combining Google calendars 
-	On boarding – administrator wants to provide registered volunteers with
information based on volunteer association and the administrator should be able
to choose the provided and distributed information.    
</code></pre>

<pre><code>Design Approaches – Questions to ask Sean

-	Make an UI prototype to show Sean, he should be able to tell us what he
likes and what he doesn’t like. We can then ask him regarding appearance
preference. Prototyping user interface done by drawings to show Sean is suggested
-	Ask Sean about their provided service, and backend and ask if we can
have a look a code by Jason. They may not provide us with information, but
we should still try to save work by asking information so integration will be easier. 
-	There are 3 angles, functionality, user interface, back end angle
-	Which aspects of the competing systems does he like?   
-	Ask if we can see some of Jason’s code?
   
</code></pre>

<pre><code>Existing Systems to Research 

Comparing and getting ideas with suggested existing systems
1)	Kin HR - UI
2)	Volunteer Squared – functionality 
3)	Base Camp, Catchafire – CRM aspects

5)	Linkedin Volunteering 
 
</code></pre>
