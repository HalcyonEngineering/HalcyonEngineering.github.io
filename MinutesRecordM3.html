<pre><code>
Issue 1 - Preparing Questions for the Client Meeting:
 
	SRS is complete for the time being. During the meeting, the prepared questions for client
meeting were reviewed. As the questions created by team are posted on the share Google doc 
drive, review was done there with the team. Team notes that a question regarding what is 
“On-boarding” is needed. A question regarding the extent of the company system is also 
needed. David notes that as a registered volunteer for the company, not much information 
regarding their company system is provided. David notes that there is a large chance for 
database work involving re-organization and parsing. 
</code></pre>

Issue 2 - Client Meeting Update:

	Reporting from Jon, the meeting with the client is on Monday in room 104 of the ICCS 
building. Meeting duration is from 12:00 – 1:30 noon. David gives reminder to team to 
bring laptop for note taking. Jon has created an event on Google calendar as reminder 
for the Monday client meeting. On Monday, meeting procedures would begin with client 
going over details with a questioning session at the end. Client representative has a
Bachelor of Business Administration degree with a personal website with web development
experiences and possible skills in graphic design. David requests for team to bring a
voice recording device for client meeting. Note that there will be 18 people participating
in the meeting so asking questions may be difficult. We may need to setup a second
interview. As a team, we need to prepare are our ideas relating to the project in case
the client asks. David also asks team to look the system requirements specifications that
is posted on the Google drive, to know things about system acronyms and etc. Chapter 1
and 2 of the SRS should be done after the first meeting. We should be familiarized with
System Requirements and Client questions and have them available during the client meeting.
Both documents are available on the shared Google drive.
