and security question, reset password.
-	Import CSV – the system must be able to provide option for existing CSV
template transfer. Also need to manually add data into the database. The
improvement is to upload CSV is template like Mail Chimp. There will be no
update CSV option. Duplication handing for ignoring duplicates for duplicate
accounts.    
-	Add/remove volunteers – access a list of volunteers and add them to a
selected project, remove by selection and secondary confirmation.
-	 Filter Search volunteers - Five fields: names, projects, skill sets,
availability and location by city. Actions then could be performed on the
result list. Search fields will be down by drop down selection.
(availability minimal: weekends, weekdays, evening, evening + weekends, 
any time (there will be 4 check boxes for a total of 16 combinations))  
-	Task/Roles – You have to have an existing project to have roles, roles to
have tasks (strict hierarchy). Roles can be edited after assignment.
-	Assigning roles – Start with list of volunteers, you have option to assign
all (Note* there is NO project assignment, but only assignment to roles,
volunteer accounts in the system by default should be a part of an organization).
Roles should also include general role position.   
-	Managing cloud documents to project teams – modifiable by projects (min),
set visibility depending on roles (optional), repository for the ENTIRE
organization is also necessary (option).  Organization level, Project level,
Individual Level (optional, Project level sharing is min). Uploading documents
with the same name would be given a re-naming option or confirmation.   
-	On-boarding page setup based on role – Template page setup (min) for entering
information. Template will have welcome “name`”, links to files, contact info etc. 
-	Email messaging system – find volunteers and email all (min), in system
messaging system like Facebook (optional). Messaging + notification between 
managers to volunteers.
